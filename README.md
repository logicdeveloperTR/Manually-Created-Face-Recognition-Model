# Manually-Created-Face-Recognition-Model
I have created an algorithm similar to FaceNet (not as completely same as FaceNet because of the GPU limitations) , optimized it and used it. This algorithm is tested for only one person but if you want, you can use more than one positive and anchor values to train the network. Furthermore, this algorithm is sensitive to light and position of face.<br>
This project is tested with GTX 1050<br>
This algorithm is sensitive to light and position of the video camera<br>
This algorithm is tested for only one people, you can test it with more positive and anchor values if you want<br>
I haven't tested this algorithm with similar faces<br>
Github displays only 1000 photo of humans<br>
